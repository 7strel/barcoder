# Barcoder

An experimental app, built with Flutter, for cataloging book and e-book
collections. Not completed, may never be. Don't view this as authoritative best

If you see something broken, let me know. If you see something that's poorly
written, let me know. It's probably accidental -- and I'll learn something from
you!
