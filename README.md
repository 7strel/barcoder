# Barcoder

An experimental app, built with Flutter, for cataloging book and e-book
collections. Not completed, may never be. 

Disclaimer: Don't view this as authoritative best practice guidance: I'm a
product manager, not a technical architect. In the unfortunate case that you
discover this code, you're welcome to take inspiration from it, but there are
almost certainly better examples out there for your use case!

That said, if you see something broken, let me know. If you see something that's
poorly written, let me know. It's probably accidental -- and I'll learn
something from you!

## Warning

I deliberately work on the bleeding edge `master` channel, since I'm on the
Flutter team and I have a high tolerance for bugs (we want to see if something
is broken before it makes its way into more stable channels). As a result, this
code might not work on the `stable` build. I've tried to document breaking
changes where possible, but no guarantees.
